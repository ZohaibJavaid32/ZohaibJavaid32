## Hi there 👋I am Muhammad Zohaib

## About Me 🚀  
🎓 I'm currently working as a **Database Engineer** with hands-on experience in managing and optimizing databases.  
🔨 I’m expanding my knowledge into **Data Engineering, Data Science, and AI**, focusing on tools and concepts like Python, SQL, cloud platforms, and ETL pipelines.  
👨‍💻 I'm especially curious about **Machine Learning and AI applications**, and I enjoy building projects that help me learn and apply these concepts in real-world scenarios.
